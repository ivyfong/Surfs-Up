# Unit 10 â€“ SQL Alchemy Homework, SurfsUp

The objective of this project is to use Python and SQL Alchemy to analyze climate data for Honolulu, Hawaii stored in an SQLite database. The following analyses were completed:

* **Precipitation Analysis:** Analysis of the last 12 months of precipitation data.
* **Station Analysis:** Analysis of the number of temperature observations taken at each station.
* **Temperature Analysis I:** A t-test was conducted to compare the average temperature in June with the average temperature in December.
* **Temperature Analysis II:** The minimum, average, and maximum temperature were calculated for a date range (January 1-7) and presented in a bar chart.
* **Daily Rainfall Average:** The daily rainfall average and daily normals (minimum, average, and maximum temperature) were calculated for a date range (January 1-7) and presented in a table and area plot, respectively.

A Flask API was created based on the first 2 analyses completed.
